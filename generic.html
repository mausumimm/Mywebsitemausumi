										<h2><a href="#">Simile: SME Sustainability - Learnings from Giants <br />
										 Dissertation (Masters) </a></h2>

									<p> My dissertation project, collaboration with Novartis, exhibited a blend of technological capability, analytical delicacy, and business acumen, giving rise to "Simile: SME Sustainability - Learnings from Giants." Using sophisticated PDF analysis, this one-of-a-kind solution employed GPT technology to give personalised sustainability advice to Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs). I developed a new business framework for the banking, real estate, and food/beverage industries that combines current sustainability criteria with actionable advice. A game-changing ESG framework also helped SMEs enhance their sustainability compliance and ESG scores. Strategy planning, interactive presentations, and data extraction from sources like Wikipedia, LinkedIn, and the Financial Times were among my tasks. This joint journey highlighted the power of interdisciplinary teamwork in tackling the sustainability challenges of small and medium-sized businesses. </p>

									<p> The analysis strongly shows that the market value of various corporations may fall. This claim is bolstered significantly by thorough post-lockdown market research and comprehensive analyses. As a result, organisations that are recovering from the adversities caused by COVID-19 are likely to have a significant volume of negative sentiment-bearing tweets. Although these sentiments may no longer make up the majority of a company's social media presence, their impact on the company's market value is still noticeable.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Forecasting Energy Gap in Ireland <br />
											Business Forecasting (Masters)</a></h2>

									<p> The project, which started in August 2020, intends to estimate energy supply and demand trends in Ireland over one and four years. We chose the Holt-Winters model for forecasting after extensive model testing because of its unrivalled accuracy. As we looked deeper into future energy demand, we used the seasonal-naive model to estimate the energy gap between supply and consumption. For the year 2024, the projections showed an energy output of around 2950 GWh (monthly peak value) versus a demand of around 3900 GWh (monthly peak value). These findings highlight remarkable consistency in energy production patterns, including renewable sources, from 2020 to 2024. Consumption, on the other hand, is expected to rise by 3% throughout this time period.A approach to bridging the energy gap appears to be the optimal deployment of renewable energy power plants. This strategy minimises not just reliance on nonrenewable resources, but also energy and operational expenses. Wind, solar, and other renewable energy sources are viable options. A single wind turbine, for example, can generate up to 6 GWh per year on average. Similarly, solar panels can create up to 0.0026 GWh, which is enough to meet a portion of the 0.0045 GWh energy requirement per residence.</p>

										<h2><a href="#"> Reasons for Attrition at IBM <br />
											Data Mining (Masters)</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1U9TinQNFc9y9YvxPB1bT_S128zrt9zpa" alt="" /></a>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1TgG2C828CRW6peXJD8fiJuzsFG1b1HAu" alt="" /></a>
									<p> The purpose of this project was to identify the factors that affect an employee’s attrition. Given that Logistic Regression had the highest accuracy, lowest misclassification, good sensitivity, and was classified as the best predictor for attrition within IBM, we advise IBM to pay close attention to two factors that contribute significantly to attrition in the company. Here we are using intercept to compare different variables to select the ones that highly impact the attrition rate, as logistic regression analysis estimates the log odds of an event. The model suggests that OverTime is the most significant influencer of attrition rate. Using logistic regression, we observed that employees who spent extra hours at work had the highest likelihood of leaving the company. </p>

										<h2><a href="#"> Optimization of Maintenance Schedules by Predictive Maintenance for Suzuki’s Autonomous Vehicles <br />
											Big Data and AI in Business (Masters)</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1G_cf_4VBUfv80g-huvqNBNqrsbveamCU" alt="" /></a>
									<p> This project revolves around implementing predictive maintenance in autonomous vehicles, which can revolutionise Suzuki by reducing costs, enhancing reliability, and ensuring safety. Despite challenges with false alarms in condition monitoring, integrating advanced sensors, AI, and data analytics can prevent issues and elevate accuracy. This approach has the potential to cut costs, minimise downtime, and boost safety. The AI plan's development, deployment, and maintenance stages are outlined for success. While initial costs are notable, the booming predictive maintenance market, projected to reach USD 41.89 Billion by 2030, justifies this essential, long-term investment for Suzuki's growth and reputation. </p>
